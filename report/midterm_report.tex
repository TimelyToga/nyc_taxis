\section*{Abstract}
In our final project, we analyze NYC's {\textit very} public taxi dataset \cite{dataset} for interesting and surprising results. Our analysis has been principally done through queries on a SQL database, but because of the geographic nature of the data, we were forced to visualize from a very early stage in our project's formation. During this preliminary stage of developing our project, we have established an efficient workflow and found areas to engage in a more prolonged analysis during the remainder of the semester.
